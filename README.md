A smart assistant to help note down and answer my questions

Primarily the smart assistant would take a note of all the questions that I get throughout my waking time.
It would try to assign tags to those questions and try to group them by similarties.
At the end of each day, the smart assistant would tell me all the questions that I had.
This would help to know my areas of interest and what I need to research on specifically.
